# Guide notes

This section is a compilation of *special* things you can find in both the Java Guide and Python Guide.

## "Advanced Knowledge" sections

These sections are "advanced" sections that are part of a normal topic. In these sections, more "internal" digging is done, diving deeper into the topic itself than needed.

However, these sections are not required, nor needed. They are there purely for the expansion and enhancement of your understanding in a "niche" topic in the current section.

## "Level 2" topics

::: tip
These topics, as of now, only exist in the Python Guide.
:::

A "Level 2" topic is a topic that is either a topic mentioned, but not fully discussed, or a topic that extends upon previous knowledge, without actually being in the curriculum. This is here to serve as extra reading, and can be skipped without having any effect on the normal topics.

Unlike an "Advanced Knowledge" section, the topic itself is advanced, rather than a niche part of it.
