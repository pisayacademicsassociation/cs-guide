It also points to it&#39;s <em>child</em> nodes.</li><li>Edge - An <strong>edge</strong> is the link connecting one node to another. These are commonly represented as <em>arrows</em>.</li><li>Root - A <strong>root</strong>, or <strong>root node</strong>, is the first node in a tree.</li><li>Parent node - A <strong>parent node</strong>, or <strong>internal node</strong>, is a <strong>node</strong> that has an edge connecting to a bottom node, commonly referred to as a <strong>child node</strong></li><li>Child node - A <strong>child node</strong> is a node located below a certain node connected by an edge.</li><li>Leaf - A <strong>leaf</strong> or <strong>leaf node</strong> is a node that does not connect to any child nodes.</li><li>Ancestors - Are nodes on the path from the current node to the root.</li><li>Descendants - Are nodes on the path from the current node to a leaf.</li><li>Subtree - Represents the descendants of a node.</li><li>Visiting - Checking the value of a node.</li><li>Traversing - Passing through nodes in a specific order.</li><li>Levels - The &quot;generation&quot; of a node.
