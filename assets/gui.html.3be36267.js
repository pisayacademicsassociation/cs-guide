While this is a valid way of doing so, it&#39;s quite ugly to look at when you think about it. I mean, who would want to look at a block of text in a black screen? Additionally, this current system of inputs and outputs is not-so-friendly to a casual person using programs. This is where a Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short, come in. Instead of a text-based interaction with the program, GUIs use visual representations to simplify and enhance the user experience.</p><p>GUIs are designed to make software and devices more user-friendly, and have become the standard interface for a wide range of applications, from operating systems to productivity software and games.</p><h2 id="creating-a-java-gui" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-java-gui" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Creating a Java GUI</h2><p>For this section of the guide, we recommend using NetBeans (Apache NetBeans).
